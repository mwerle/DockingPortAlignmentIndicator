# DockingPortAlignmentIndicator

This is a copy of NavyFish's Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod for Kerbal Space Program.

**Please do NOT bother NavyFish with any bugs arising from using this unofficial version**

The current version is based on the current (as of 2019-10-29) v6.8.3 release from NavyFish available on [SpaceDock](https://spacedock.info/mod/543/Docking%20Port%20Alignment%20Indicator). 
It was then modified to remove some runtime warnings and recompiled and tested on KSP v1.8.0.

The [forum thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=40423) contains all remaining relevant information.
